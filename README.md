# SoCure
## The Problem
The COVID 19 outbreak has placed unprecedented demands on our health system. Prescribed medicines and other drugs are essential to the lives of many people. Lockdown has everyone stuck in their homes. The problem faced by the people are as follows:
- It is likely that going shopping for medicines and other medicinal products and consulting medical practitioners during this time may be deferred because of social/physical distancing requirements or community reluctance owing to perceptions that pharmacies may be infected.
- Older citizens might not be able to get to their nearest pharmacies because of the lockdown and the fear of catching Covid-19.
- Unavailability of a medicine in the nearest/ preferred pharmacy can lead to the lack of medicine which can cause certain problems for a patient. 
- People cannot consult their doctors for regular check ups unless it is an emergency. 
Retail sale of drugs to the doorstep of consumers is essential to meet the requirements of the emergency arising due to pandemic COVID-19 and it is necessary to regulate the sale and distribution of drugs for their delivery to the consumers during and after the lockdown. 
## Our Solution
Continuing to provide essential services is important not only to maintain peopleâ€™s trust in the health system to deliver essential health services , but also to minimize an increase in morbidity and mortality from other health conditions. __SoCure__ not only delivers the drugs to your doorstep but also connects you to your doctor so you can consult them for your regular medicine use and basic updates.
To provide ease, we connect all the pharmacies in the customers' area so that when they buy the meds, it gets them from the closest available pharmacy. Multiple pharmacies provide home delivery for convenience to the ones in need. But sometimes, your preferred pharmacy runs out of the required medicine. In order to add even more ease, we intend on creating an application where you just need to select your meds and we shall order them for you from the nearby pharmacy. There will also be an option to consult a medical practitioner and get an alternative to the medicine.
## Implementation
We plan on making an app which connects the nearby pharmacies with the customers to provide delivery of medicines not only during but also after lockdown. The app will consist of the following features:
- __Online Shopping:__ Providing an ease to purchasing meds. Basic medicine can be bought without the need of a prescription but in limited quantities while heavy medicines will require the upload of a prescription. 
- __In-App Consultancy:__ Users can connect with a doctor online to get their daily check-ups done without any risk in the least. After the consultancy, the doctor can upload the prescription which makes it easier for the patient to purchase medicines.
- __Alternate Medicines:__ The users can make a request for an alternate medicine from the doctors in case the ones they require are out of stock in the region.
